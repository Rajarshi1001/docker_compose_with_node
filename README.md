## This is a simple express app to demonstrate docker-compose.

This helps you get acquainted with the powers of Docker-Compose. I have also
written a blog based on this providing detailed instructions to spin up the 
application and the Mongo Container.

Inorder to follow the instructions as mentioned in the Medium blog, first delete
Dockerfile, dockercompose.yaml and the .dockerignore file. I have also mentioned
the possible errors that might occur on running __docker compose up__ on your system 
for the first time.
 
#### First run the following command inside the directory (__express_try__) to install the node_modules folder which contains the necessary packages and dependencies.

```
npm install
```
